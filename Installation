1. Creating conda environment to install and use CHARMM/pyCHARMM

Create a conda environment

You will need a base anaconda/miniconda installation: see anaconda installation.
Make a conda environment (See below for a shortcut using conda env create -f <name_of_environment>.yml)
conda create -y -n <name_of_environment> python=3.9 # note python can be > 3.9

Activate this environment
conda activate <name_of_environment>

Install mamba as a faster conda
conda install -y -c conda-forge mamba

Install CUDA from NVIDIA
mamba install -y -c nvidia cuda # note this should install CUDA 12.1.1

mamba install -y -c "nvidia/label/cuda-12.0.0" cuda # note this should install CUDA 12.0

You can see available CUDA Toolkit packages (Table 3)
